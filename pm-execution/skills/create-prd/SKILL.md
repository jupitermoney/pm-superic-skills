# Create a Product Requirements Document

## Purpose

You are an experienced principal product manager responsible for creating a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) for $ARGUMENTS. This document will serve as the authoritative specification for your product or feature, aligning stakeholders and guiding development.

## Context

A well-structured PRD clearly communicates the what, why, and how of your product initiative. This skill uses a 10-section template proven to communicate product vision effectively to engineers, analysts, designers, leadership, and stakeholders.

This is an **iterative process**. You do not need all the answers upfront. Share what you know and the skill will draft the PRD with your current context. As you gather more data, research, or stakeholder input, come back and add it — the skill will update the PRD accordingly. The goal is to make progress, not to wait for perfection.

## Instructions

### Phase 0 — Setup (always run this first)

**Step 1: Check Atlassian MCP connectivity**

Silently attempt to call the Atlassian MCP tool. If the connection is active, note it and proceed. If it is not connected, tell the user:

> "Atlassian MCP is not connected. Once we finish the PRD, you will not be able to publish it directly to Confluence. To enable publishing, connect the Atlassian MCP integration and restart this skill. You can continue without it for now."

Do not block PRD creation if MCP is unavailable. Proceed regardless.

**Step 1b: Surface existing research (optional)**

Tell the user:

> "Before we start — if you want to ground this PRD in existing Jupiter user research, run `/find-research [topic]` to check what studies already exist. It takes 30 seconds and gives you a ready-to-paste evidence block for the Problem Statement and User Insights sections. You can skip this and add research later."

Do not block or wait. Proceed to Step 2 immediately after showing this message.

---

**Step 2: Size the initiative**

Before asking anything else, ask the user one question to determine PRD scope:

> "Before we start — how big is this initiative?
> - **Quick build** (days to 2 weeks): I'll create a one-page PRD
> - **Medium feature** (2–6 weeks): I'll create a focused full PRD
> - **Large initiative** (quarter or more): I'll create a comprehensive PRD with phasing, risks, and experiment design
>
> Take your best guess — we can adjust as we go."

Use the answer to calibrate output length and depth throughout.

**Step 3: Frame the process**

Tell the user:

> "This is an iterative process. Share what you know today — even if it is incomplete. I will draft the PRD from your current context, flag gaps clearly, and you can keep adding information as you learn more. We will keep refining it together."

**Step 4: Gather inputs with optional clarifying questions**

Ask the user to share a brain dump of everything they know about the initiative. Prompt them with:

> "Tell me everything you know — the problem, who it affects, any data you have, rough solution ideas, timelines, or constraints. There are no wrong answers. Bullet points are fine."

Then, based on gaps in their input, selectively ask from the following question bank. **These questions are optional — only ask what is genuinely missing from their brain dump. Never ask more than 5 clarifying questions at once. If the user does not have an answer, move on.**

**Problem Space (ask if problem is vague)**
- What is the core problem in one sentence?
- Who specifically experiences it — which user segment, and how do you know?
- How was this discovered — data, research, user complaints, exec request?
- Have we tried to solve this before? What happened?
- What is the cost of not solving this — revenue, retention, trust, or something else?

**Evidence and Data (ask if no data is shared)**
- What quantitative data exists? (funnel drop, DAU impact, revenue loss, error rate)
- What qualitative data exists? (interviews, NPS, support tickets, surveys)
- What is the current baseline for the metric we want to move?
- Is this problem validated with real users, or is it currently an assumption?

**Strategic Fit (ask if context or urgency is missing)**
- Which OKR or company priority does this serve?
- Why now versus 6 months ago?
- What are we not doing by prioritising this?

**Scope and Constraints (ask if solution or effort is unclear)**
- Do you have a solution hypothesis, or is this still open discovery?
- Which teams or systems will this depend on?
- Are there hard constraints — technical, legal, regulatory, or timeline?

**Audience and Output (ask once, at the end)**
- Who is the primary reader: engineering, design, leadership, or cross-functional?
- Should this include experiment or A-B test design?
- Is there a Confluence space where you want this published? (e.g. "PROD", "Growth", "Platform")

**Step 5: Show a gap confidence signal before writing**

After inputs are gathered, show this table and ask whether to proceed or fill gaps first:

```
SECTION              INPUT STRENGTH    NOTE
Problem              [Strong/Medium/Weak/Missing]    ...
Evidence             [Strong/Medium/Weak/Missing]    ...
Why Now              [Strong/Medium/Weak/Missing]    ...
Success Metrics      [Strong/Medium/Weak/Missing]    ...
Solution             [Strong/Medium/Weak/Missing]    ...
Constraints          [Strong/Medium/Weak/Missing]    ...
```

Then ask: "Should I proceed with reasonable assumptions for weak sections, or do you want to fill any gaps first?"

---

### Phase 1 — Write the PRD

**Step 6: Think step by step before writing**

Before generating the document, reason through:
- What is the problem we are solving?
- How do we know this is a problem?
- Why does it matter right now?
- Who are we solving it for?
- What would success look like?
- What are our constraints, risks and assumptions?
- What are we building?

If any of these is weak, flag it explicitly in the PRD rather than silently filling it with assumptions.

**Step 7: Apply the PRD Template**

Create a document with these 10 sections:

   **Context** (2-3 sentences)
   - What changed in the business/product/market?
   - What triggered this PRD now?
   - One-line framing of the opportunity

   **What is the problem we are trying to solve**
   - Precise description of the problem
   - User impact (who feels this and how)
   - Business impact (revenue/retention/growth)
   - What's the objective? Why does it matter?
  
   **How do we know this is a problem**
  
   - Data evidence quantitative - funnel drop, revenue loss, retention issue, low engagement - other metrics
   - Qualitative data through NPS, user survey, research or other means

   **Why Now**
   - What makes this urgent vs. 6 months ago?
   - What capabilities/data are now ready?
   - What happens if we don't solve this?

   **What does success look like**
   How would we know we have solved the problem?
   Key Results: How will you measure success? (Use SMART OKR format)
   Present as a table to have starting point (where are we today) and end point (where do we want to get to)
   
   - Primary metric (the one number that matters)
   - Supporting metrics (2-4)
   - Guardrail metrics (what must NOT worsen)
   - Measurement timeline

   **Market Segment(s)**
   Optional - do only if needed - validate from the user
   - For whom are we building this?
   - What constraints exist?
   - Note: Markets are defined by people's problems/jobs, not demographics

   **Value Proposition(s)**
   - What customer jobs/needs are we addressing?
   - What will customers gain?
   - Which pains will they avoid?
   - Which problems do we solve better than competitors?
   - Consider the Value Curve framework

   **Solution**
   - Approach overview
   - Key Features (detailed feature descriptions)
   - UX/Prototypes (wireframes, user flows)
   - Technology (optional, only if relevant)
   - Prioritisation (P0/P1/P2)
   - Out of scope (explicit)

   **Edge Cases & Risks**
   - Edge cases with handling
   - Risks with mitigation
   - Rollback plan

   **Release**
   - Phase breakdown with scope
   - Dependencies and sequencing
   - Avoid exact dates; use relative timeframes
   - Definition of done of a phase (how would you know when to move to next phase)
   
   **Open Questions**
   - Explicitly unresolved items with owners
     
**Step 8: Use Accessible Language**

Write for a primary school graduate. Avoid jargon. Use clear, short sentences. Do not use acronyms without spelling them out first. Do not use em dashes anywhere.

**Step 9: Structure Output**

Present the PRD as a well-formatted markdown document with clear headings and sections.

---

### Phase 2 — Review and Publish

**Step 10: PRD Rating**

After generating the PRD, rate it using the criteria defined in the PRD Quality Levels section. Show the rating and a one-line reason for any section that scored below Level 3.

**Step 11: Present for Review**

Always present the PRD as a draft first. Do not publish automatically. Tell the user:

> "Here is your PRD draft. Review it and let me know if you want to change anything. Once you confirm it is ready, I will publish it to Confluence."

**Step 12: Confirm and Publish to Confluence**

Only after the user explicitly says the PRD is ready to publish:

1. If Atlassian MCP is connected, ask: "Which Confluence space should I publish this to? (e.g. PROD, Growth, Platform — or paste a space URL)"
2. Use `createConfluencePage` to publish the PRD to the specified space in markdown format
3. Return the Confluence page URL to the user once created

If MCP is not connected, save the PRD as a markdown file instead: `PRD-[product-name].md` and confirm the file path to the user.

## Notes

- Be specific and data-driven where possible
- Link each section back to the overall strategy
- Flag assumptions clearly so the team can validate them
- Keep the document concise but complete
- Avoid using acronyms, dont use em dashes anywhere

## The 5 Core Skills

---

### Skill 1: Problem Sharpening

**Bad:**
> "Users are dropping off during onboarding"

**Good:**
> "Only 10% of new users successfully onboard onto a product 
> post-activation. Drop-offs are unrecovered in-app — there is 
> no lifecycle-aware rescue flow on the home screen."

**The technique:**
```
Step 1: State the symptom
Step 2: Add the number
Step 3: Add the consequence
Step 4: Add why current state can't fix it

Template:
"[X% of users] experience [specific friction]
at [specific moment], resulting in [measured outcome].
Currently [no mechanism exists / wrong mechanism is used]
to address this."
```

---

### Skill 2: Metric Selection

Most people pick metrics that are easy to measure,
not metrics that matter.

**The Metric Hierarchy:**
```
NORTH STAR METRIC
└── What single number captures the goal?
    e.g. M1 Retention

PRIMARY METRICS (2-3)
└── What directly moves the north star?
    e.g. % users doing 3+ txns in 14 days

SECONDARY METRICS (2-4)
└── What are early signals we're on track?
    e.g. CTR on lifecycle widgets

GUARDRAIL METRICS
└── What must NOT get worse?
    e.g. App crash rate, CSAT score
```

**Common mistake to avoid:**
Setting targets without baselines.

```
Wrong:
"Increase BillPay adoption"

Right:
"Increase BillPay adoption from 2.5% → 3%
in non-TPAP cohorts within 60 days of launch"
```

---

### Skill 3: Scoping Decisions

The hardest part of a PRD isn't what to include.
It's what to explicitly exclude.

**Framework:**
```
For every potential feature, ask:

1. MUST HAVE     Breaks core experience if absent?
2. SHOULD HAVE   Significantly improves outcome?
3. NICE TO HAVE  Good but not outcome-critical?
4. NOT NOW       Valid but wrong timing or phase?
5. NEVER         Out of scope for this PRD entirely?
```

**Rule:**
Every out-of-scope item should say WHEN it will be addressed.

```
Good example:
Out of Scope for Phase 1:
✓ Phase 2 progression list widget     → Phase 2
✓ Savings account card redesign       → Phase 2
✓ AA linking / Investments onboarding → Phase 3
```

---

### Skill 4: Writing for Multiple Readers

A PRD has 4 audiences with different needs:

```
READER           WHAT THEY NEED
──────────────────────────────────────────────
Engineering      Exact specifications, edge cases,
                 technical constraints, APIs needed

Design           User states, flows, principles,
                 component hierarchy, content rules

Data/Analytics   Metric definitions, tracking events,
                 experiment design, cohort logic

Leadership       Business case, ROI, risk, timeline,
                 strategic fit
```

**Technique:**
Write once, signal to each audience via section headers.

```
→ "Technical Considerations"  for Eng
→ "Design / UX Principles"    for Design
→ "Tracking Requirements"     for Data
→ "Success Metrics"           for Leadership
```

---

### Skill 5: The "So What" Test

After every claim in your PRD, ask: "So what?"

```
WEAK CHAIN:
"We have low M3 retention"

STRONGER CHAIN:
"We have low M3 retention (~18%)"
→ So what?
"Users who don't adopt retention products
 (BillPay, Pots, Investments) churn before
 they're profitable"
→ So what?
"This prevents cross-sell into CC and Loans —
 our primary revenue products"
→ So what?
"AOP revenue targets cannot be hit without
 fixing this funnel"
```

Each "so what" makes the business case harder to dismiss.

## Red Flags Checklist

Before submitting any PRD, verify:

```
PROBLEM SECTION
□ Every problem has a data point
□ Data is sourced — not "we think" or "probably"
□ User impact is described, not just business impact
□ Root cause is identified, not just symptom

SOLUTION SECTION
□ At least 2 alternatives were considered
□ Why this solution vs alternatives is explained
□ Dependencies on other teams are named
□ Edge cases are handled, not deferred

METRICS SECTION
□ Baseline numbers exist for all targets
□ Guardrail metrics are defined
□ Measurement method is specified
□ Timeline for measurement is set

EXECUTION SECTION
□ Phases are clearly bounded
□ Out of scope is explicitly listed
□ Open questions have owners and deadlines
□ Rollback plan exists
```

---

## The One-Page PRD

For smaller features, compress the PRD to this:

```
PROBLEM
In one sentence: what is broken and how do we know?
[Data point]

WHY NOW
One reason this can't wait.

SOLUTION
What we're building in 3 bullet points.

SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE
[Metric]: [Current] → [Target] by [Date]

OUT OF SCOPE
3 things we are explicitly NOT doing.

OPEN QUESTIONS
[Question] | Owner: [Name] | Due: [Date]
```

---

## PRD Quality Levels

```
LEVEL 1 — DRAFT
• Problem is described qualitatively
• Solution is roughly defined
• No metrics

LEVEL 2 — REVIEW READY
• Problem has supporting data
• Solution has scope and phasing
• Success metrics defined with baselines

LEVEL 3 — EXECUTION READY
• All edge cases handled
• Tracking instrumentation specified
• Experiment design included
• Rollback plan exists
• All stakeholders have reviewed

LEVEL 4 — EXCELLENT
• Alternative solutions evaluated
• Cost/ROI analysis included
• User research cited
• Phased metrics per launch stage
• Post-launch review plan defined
```

## The Core Principle

> The best PRDs don't just describe what to build.
> They make it impossible for a reasonable person
> to argue against building it — and equally impossible
> to build the wrong thing.
